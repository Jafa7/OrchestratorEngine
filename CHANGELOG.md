# Changelog

All notable changes to OrchestratorEngine are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Read-only `status` aggregates doctor, wake channel, worker task and
  verification check summaries into one compact operator report.
- `report draft` creates a Markdown GitHub issue draft from the compact
  status report.
- GitHub issue templates and operator reporting docs standardize
  adopter-project problem reports.
- Project/source label conventions identify report origin independently of the
  GitHub account that created the issue.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Stable v0.1 file contracts for terminal events, inbox signals, bindings,
  wake targets, watcher state, worker tasks and verification results.
- Detached worker dispatch with durable stdout/stderr/result/evidence
  artifacts.
- Per-task `wake_target` snapshots so multi-chat dispatch wakes the chat that
  launched each task.
- Callback wakeups for Codex and VS Code hosts, plus stream wakeups for Claude
  hosts.
- Watcher service control, heartbeat/status diagnostics and stale/crashed
  service warnings.
- Deferred callback state with bounded retries, manual-required quota
  handling and explicit acknowledgement.
- Reference verification runner and worker profile examples.
- Read-only `worker diagnose` reports advisory profile diagnostics with
  deterministic severities and automation-friendly exit codes.
- Read-only `worker tasks` reports runtime diagnostics for detached task
  artifacts, stale heartbeats and missing results/evidence.
- Read-only `checks` reports compact verification status, summary paths and
  failed command logs for `.orchestrator/checks` artifacts.
- `watcher service status` warns when a bare legacy status view differs from
  the bound host-scoped callback channel.
- Install smoke coverage that exercises the installed CLI without
  `PYTHONPATH`.

### Documented

- Host live-wakeup limits, including Codex Desktop Windows durable delivery
  versus true live wakeup.
- Non-interactive worker profile guidance for Codex, Claude and Copilot.
- Setup guide for adopting OrchestratorEngine in a clean project.

### Notes

- OrchestratorEngine is provider-neutral core infrastructure. Project-specific
  adapters, private paths and retention policies belong in adopting projects.
